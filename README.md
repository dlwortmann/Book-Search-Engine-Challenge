## Description
In this project I was given a full stack application for a book search engine that used RESTful API. The challenge was to refactor the application to a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. I also had to update authentication middleware to reflect the change to the GraphQL API. The application was then deployed to Render.

## Installation
1. Clone the repo onto your machine using the command "git clone" using the SSH key from the repository.
2. Open respository in VS code (download this if necessary). 
3. Install necessary packages by running "npm install". 
4. Build application by running "npm run build".
5. Run "npm run develop" to get the server running and see the application working in the browser.

## Usage Information
Once server is running, the Apollo Sandbox can be used to test routes for getting, updating, posting, and deleting data on the search engine.

## Contribution Guidelines
I am open to collaborations. Any changes should made on a feature branch and pull requests will need to be reviewed before being added to the main branch.

## Credits
My TA Allan assisted in working out some errors I was getting when trying to seed the data and making sure my routes were working correctly . The Xpert Learning Assistant on BootCampSpot was able to suggest solutions for other issues in the application.
